  "description": "Dragonbane Timekeeping (DB Time) implements simple timekeeping for the Dragonbane game system on top of the Global Progress Clocks module. \n\nIt has the following main features:\n<ul>\n  <li>Tracks the time in stretches and shifts, and optionally in hours and days.</li>\n  <li>Can post the time in hours and minutes and day to chat.</li>\n  <li>Provides hooks for easy customisation when the time changes.</li>\n  <li>Can be easily modified for other game systems.</li>\n  <li>Never takes control away from the GM. This module keeps track of the time, but the GM is always in charge of the rate at which time advances.</li>\n</ul>",
