# Easy Timekeeping

> [!CAUTION]
> This module is still a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use. It has not been released. If you really want some timekeeping goodness, you'll be better off with [the original macro version](https://github.com/DC23/foundry-macros/blob/main/dbtime/dbtime-readme.md). I don't maintain that version anymore, and it's harder to install than this module, but at least it's ready to use now.

***Easy Timekeeping*** implements simple timekeeping without any fuss or complicated features. I originally wrote this as a set of macros for the [Dragonbane game system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dragonbane), built on top of the [Global Progress Clocks](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/global-progress-clocks) module. While those [macros are still available](https://github.com/DC23/foundry-macros/blob/main/dbtime/dbtime-readme.md), I don't maintain them anymore, they are fragile, and relatively difficult to install.

In it's current form, Easy Timekeeping is no longer uniquely tailored to the Dragonbane RPG, though it still works wonderfully with the 15 minute stretches and 6 hour shifts of that game. It's a lightweight, customisable, and easy to use timekeeping tool for any game.

Easy Timekeeping has the following main features:

- TODO: a feature
- TODO: the second feature
- TODO: feature the third
- Provides hooks for easy customisation when the time changes.

I had a few goals when creating this system:

- The GM is always in control. While this module keeps track of the passage of time, it never takes decisions away from the GM.

## So, What About that SmallTime Module?

I owe a huge debt to the wonderful [SmallTime](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/smalltime) module, whose UI I have adapted (hooray for the MIT licence!). Since this means that on the surface, Easy Timekeeping looks and works much the same as SmallTime, I probably should spend a little time explaining why I created Easy Timekeeping when SmallTime already does the same job.
